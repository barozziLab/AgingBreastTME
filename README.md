# Age-Dependent Differences in Breast Tumor Microenvironment
A repository of code for data analysis/processing generated for the study of age-dependent differences in the breast tumor microenvironment.

The study was performed in collaboration at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) and the Center for Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna (MUW). The dataset contains transcriptional profiles of tumors and the tumor microenvironment in adult (12 months) and young (6-8 weeks) mice, generated by orthotopic injection of 20k 4t1 cells into the mammary fat pad.

Primary findings for this project were published here: (paper link to be added)

The raw data can be accessed at: GSE252968 (new data) and GSE191246 (previously published in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-022-00893-x)

An intermediate object that can be used together with the provided code to reproduce the figures from the publication, but also including further exploratory analyses we conducted is available on zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13960874.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13960874)
