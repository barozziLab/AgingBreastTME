# Age-Dependent Differences in Breast Tumor Microenvironment
A repository of code for data analysis/processing generated for the study of age-dependent differences in the breast tumor microenvironment.

The study was performed in collaboration at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) and the Center for Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna (MUW). The dataset contains transcriptional profiles of tumors and the tumor microenvironment in adult (12 months) and young (6-8 weeks) mice, generated by orthotopic injection of 20k 4t1 cells into the mammary fat pad.
